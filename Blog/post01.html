                    <p>Here we go again. Version 3.0.0</p>
                    <p>In my professional career I have had two paths, versions or takes. In each one I have learned things about myself and what I want/need in a professional carrer. The sports industry was v1.0, non-profits v2.0 and now v3.0 as a coader in website development. Thanks to The Iron Yard and my family for making this a possibility.</p>
                    <p> I earned my bachelors degree in education with an emphasis in sport management from Florida State University in 2001. During that time I was able to intern in the athletics under sports information. While doing research, writing media guides, and providing support during intercollegiate athletic events. I was offered and accepted a position as an equipment manager and home events manager for the soccer, softball and golf teams. While performing these duties in 2002 I earned my Masters degree in Education with and emphasis in Sport Administration. For my last two classes in my Masters program I was accepted in to the inagural session for the Global Sport Managment study abroad program in Paris and London. It was on that trip that I discovered a passion for travel, exploration, and reignitgted my longing for adventure.</p>
                    <p>Upon my return from Europe I felt the need to give back to my community and accepted an offer with the non-profit Hillel. Over the next twelve years I had the privledge to mentor college students and guide them on personal growth and identity development. I was able to encorporate my love for adventure and travel and intermingled it with my professsional duties. Learning and perforiming almost every role and aspect of the organization was an inspiring and challenging time. It was during these years that I was exposed to HR policies that encourage personal and professional growth and a culture that establishes life priorities putting their organization 3rd on that list behind health and family. After leaving Hillel I was not sure of my next step.</p>
                    <p> A friend suggested that I work for an Apple store that she was employed at and that it was an innovative, caring , and different. I applied and was welcomed in to the Apple store family in Altamonte. It was a fast six months. During the time I spent surrounded by technology and talented individuals and seeing how they use technology to enhance peoples lives I found my 3.0 direction. Now just to find my path.</p>
                    <p>Another friend suggested that I come to a weekly gathering of entrepenurs called One Million Cups. It was at their weekly presentations that I learned of The Iron Yard. A boot camp that will train you to become a junior level programmer in just 12 weeks! That was it. After getting buy in from my family and talking to friends in the industry I signed on to the second cohort in Front End Engineering. Just completed my third week and the future looks bright. I still have so much to learn, sleep to catch up on but v3.0.0 is on the horizon.</p>

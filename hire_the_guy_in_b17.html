        <p>Dear HR Hiring Manager and Andy Keyes,</p>
        <p>I was very interested when I saw the <a href="http://www.universalorlandojobs.com/job/6296878/sr-programmer-analyst-enterprise-systems-orlando-fl/" target="_blank">posting</a> for the position of <strong>Sr. Programmer Analyst, Enterprise Systems (6296878).</strong> I would like to respectfully submit my <a href="https://sak55.github.io/documents/SamuelKauffmanResume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for your consideration.</p>
        <p>I believe that my experience here at Universal Orlando and my background, make me an excellent candidate for the position. I became a team member in July 2015, and have since worked on the Web/Ticket Config Team, participated as member of the UPT TSAT Committee, engaged in the Universal Book Club, volunteered as a mentor with our F.I.R.S.T. Robotics Team, and applied to be part of the UPT Mentoring Program. The skills I have gained in my professional and educational experiences over the years, and my intimate knowledge of the systems and culture at Universal Orlando, I believe, will be a unique asset in the position of <strong>Sr. Programmer Analyst, Enterprise Systems (6296878).</strong> For more information about my skills and me, please visit <a href='index.html' target="_blank">my portfolio</a>.</p>
        <p>The work environment at Universal Orlando is exciting and challenging, and I have found a place in Park Technology that I can continue to grow and contribute. I have learned a lot from the people I have had the pleasure of working with, and look forward to growing in my professional career here.</p>
        <!--I prefer to work on Macs-->
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration for this position. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Sam</p>
